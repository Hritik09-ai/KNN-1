    "# QUES.1 What is the KNN algorithm?\n",
    "# ANSWER KNN, or k-Nearest Neighbors, is a simple and popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. The core idea behind KNN is to predict the classification or regression value of a new data point by looking at the 'k' nearest data points in the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Training Phase: During the training phase, the algorithm simply stores all the training data points and their \n",
    "# corresponding labels (in the case of classification) or values (in the case of regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Prediction Phase: When a new data point is given for prediction, the algorithm calculates the distances between\n",
    "#  that data point and all other data points in the training set using a distance metric (typically Euclidean distance or\n",
    "#  Manhattan distance).\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Nearest Neighbors Selection: After calculating distances, the algorithm selects the 'k' nearest data points based on \n",
    "# the calculated distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Majority Voting (Classification) or Averaging (Regression): For classification tasks, the algorithm assigns the class \n",
    "# label to the new data point based on the majority class among its k nearest neighbors. For regression tasks, it \n",
    "# calculates the average of the values of the k nearest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Output: The predicted class label or regression value for the new data point is determined based on the majority \n",
    "# vote or average calculated in the previous step.\n",
    "\n",
    "# KNN is considered a non-parametric and lazy learning algorithm because it doesn't make assumptions about the \n",
    "# underlying data distribution and doesn't learn a discriminative function during training. Instead, it memorizes \n",
    "# the training dataset and performs computation at the time of prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "# One key hyperparameter in KNN is 'k', which represents the number of nearest neighbors to consider. The choice of \n",
    "# 'k' can significantly impact the performance of the algorithm, and it is often determined through cross-validation. \n",
    "# Additionally, choosing an appropriate distance metric is crucial for the effectiveness of KNN.\n"

    "# Cross-Validation: Using techniques like k-fold cross-validation, you can evaluate the performance of the KNN algorithm\n",

    "# and validating it on the remaining subset. Repeating this process with different values of K helps in selecting the\n",
    "# one that gives the best performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Grid Search: This method involves evaluating the algorithm's performance for various hyperparameters, including K,\n",
    "# by exhaustively searching through a predefined grid of parameter values. Grid search is commonly used in combination\n",
    "# with cross-validation to select the optimal K.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Elbow Method: For regression problems, plotting the error rate (e.g., mean squared error) as a function of K can\n",
    "# help identify the point where further increasing K doesn't significantly reduce the error rate. This point is \n",
